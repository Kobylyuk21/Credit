		<p>To start to imporve your credit, first step would be to check what your credit is. 
			Go online to websites like CreditKarma and check your credit score for free. 
			Next step is to pay your bills on time so your credit score will increase.
			This takes time so be patient. Make sure you try to pay off any credit card balances
			you might have faster so your credit score will increase more. Make sure you don't
			close any credit cards, even if they are paid off. This will hurt your credit score
			and cause your score to drop. Instead once your done paying it off you, cut them up
			and don't request a new card. These are the best ways on increase your credit score.
